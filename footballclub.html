            Coaches message:
            Before coming to NZ I was playing for Kawsar FC in Kabul AFG, when I came to NZ, I’ve started playing football at Coastal Spirit u15s team, then I moved to Nomads United u15s and played for them in the remaining of the season. After that I went to FC and played for FC u17s, then I moved to chch united and played two seasons at United reserves team before coming back to FC and playing in the first team.
            My biggest achievement would be winning the Regional Futsal tournament and scoring two goals in the final to win the game.
