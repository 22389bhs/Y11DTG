       </h2>
      <a>Futsal is a type of indoor football (soccer) played on a smaller, hard court, typically with five players on each team, including the goalkeeper. Unlike traditional football, futsal has different rules and a smaller, low-bounce ball that emphasises close control, quick passing, and skillful play.</a>
